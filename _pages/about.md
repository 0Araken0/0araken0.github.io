Hi there! I am Kensuke Arakawa, a graduate student at Kyoto University. 

I am broadly interested in the interaction of homotopy theory and category theory. I am especially interested in analyzing higher structures from more accesible ones, and this led me to study *localization*, *model categories*, *functor calculus*. I am also interested in applying these techniques to study manifolds.
